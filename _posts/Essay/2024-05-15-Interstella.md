### 메모:

We've always definied ourselves by the ability to overcome the impossible. And we count these moments. *The first ever to fly faster than speed of the sound.* These moments when we dared to aim higher to break barriers, to reach the stars, to make unknown known. *One giant leap for mankind* we count these moments as our proudest achievements. *Having fired the imagination of a generation* But we losts all that. *pulls into port for the last time* Or perhaps, we've just forgotten that we are still pioneers that we've barely begun.
